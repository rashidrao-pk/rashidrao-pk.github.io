### Learning Curve

Thisgraph is showng that we have total 21 epochs used and from which we have lowest MSE at epoch
no 15 which was 0.32, learning curves for training validation and testing are shown in graphs by blue,
green and red respectively.

### MLR

This graph is showing the results for line fitting for training, validation and testing of MLP.
