This package contains an implementation of the fusion algorithm described in
the paper:
"Multi-scale weighted gradient-based fusion for multi-focus image" (Information 
Fusion 2014) by Zhiqiang Zhou, Sun Li and Bo Wang.

This matlab code is not fully optimized. It is only a reference for those who
would like to implement our method. 

Usage of this code is free for research purposes only. Please refer to the 
above publication if you use this code. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run the fusion algorithm, use the Fusion_test_for_registered_img.m for well registered
source images, and Fusion_test_for_misregistered_img.m for mis-registered source images.
