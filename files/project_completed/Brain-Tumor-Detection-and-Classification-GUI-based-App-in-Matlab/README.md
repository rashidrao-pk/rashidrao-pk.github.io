# Brain-Tumor-Detection-and-Classification-GUI-based-App-in-Matlab
Brain Tumor Detection and Classification is developed for one of my Client from Malysia.
This is a GUI-based application which detects the Tumor, calculated its area and perimeter in mm.

## Demo ->

Then it classifies it into for classes.
1. No Tumor
2. Low
3. Medium
4. High

The methodology consist on following steps:

1. Load Image
2. Grayscale Conversion
3. Median Filtering
4. High Pass Filter
5. Watershed Segmentation
6. Morphological Operations
7. Tumor Area Localization
8. Tumor Boundry Plotting
9. Tumor Total Area and Perimeter Calculation
10. Type Prediction
