This blog post is written to expland and highlight our published research article 𝐂𝐚𝐧 𝐈 𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐦𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐥𝐲 𝐝𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦?, 𝐚 𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐬𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐲 𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐨𝐧 𝐞𝐗𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐀𝐈. This explores the robustness of an anomaly detection system based on variational autoencoder generative models through the use of eXplainable AI (XAI) methods. The goal is to get a different perspective on the real performances of anomaly detectors that use reconstruction differences. In this case study we discovered that, in many cases, samples are detected as anomalous for the wrong or misleading factors.
