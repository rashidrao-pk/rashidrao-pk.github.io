I'm a  Machine Learning (Computer Vision) Researcher at the University of Turin in Italy, where I have been pursuing my PhD since 2022. My research is centered on advancing machine learning techniques for Computer vision related tasks, with a recent focus on eXplainable AI (XAI) and visual anomaly detection in industrial applications.

## Research Interests
My current work involves developing a new approach for learning hard, axis-aligned decision trees using gradient descent. This method employs backpropagation with a straight-through operator on a dense decision tree representation, allowing for the joint optimization of all tree parameters. As a result, we achieve state-of-the-art performance across various domains, including interpretable decision trees and high-performance decision tree ensembles for tabular data, as well as interpretable reinforcement learning without information loss.

My primary research interests include:
* Computer Vision
* Deep Learning for Image Data
* Anomaly Detection
* Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
* Explainable Copmuter Vision (XCV)

### ðŸ¤– Using Stratified Sampling to Improve LIME Image Explanations @ AAAI-24 
* Our paper was accepted in main technical track and then as a poster presentation, only 100 random papers were selected out of 2200 accepted papers and all the papers also required to be presented as poster presentation as well including those 100 papers.

* We investigate the use of a stratified sampling approach for LIME Image, a popular model-agnostic explainable AI method for computer vision tasks, in order to reduce the artifacts generated by typical Monte Carlo sampling. Such artifacts are due to the undersampling of the dependent variable in the synthetic neighborhood around the image being explained, which may result in inadequate explanations due to the impossibility of fitting a linear regressor on the sampled data. We then highlight a connection with the Shapley theory, where similar arguments about undersampling and sample relevance were suggested in the past. We derive all the formulas and adjustment factors required for an unbiased stratified sampling estimator. Experiments show the efficacy of the proposed approach.. The method is available under: https://github.com/rashidrao-pk/lime_stratified

### ðŸ¤– Can I Trust My Anomaly Detection System? A Case Study Based on Explainable AI @ XAI-World-24 
* Our paper was accepted in main technical track and was presented in special _**session Explainable AI for improved human-computer interaction**_.

* Generative models based on variational autoencoders are a popular technique for detecting anomalies in images in a semi-supervised context. A common approach employs the anomaly score to detect the presence of anomalies, and it is known to reach high level of accuracy on benchmark datasets. However, since anomaly scores are computed from reconstruction disparities, they often obscure the detection of various spurious features, raising concerns regarding their actual efficacy. 
This case study explores the robustness of an anomaly detection system based on variational autoencoder generative models through the use of eXplainable AI methods. The goal is to get a different perspective on the real performances of anomaly detectors that use reconstruction differences. In our case study we discovered that, in many cases, samples are detected as anomalous for the wrong or misleading factors.
