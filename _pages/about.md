I'm a  Machine Learning (Computer Vision) Researcher at the University of Turin in Italy, where I have been pursuing my PhD since 2022. My research is centered on advancing machine learning techniques for Computer vision related tasks, with a recent focus on eXplainable AI (XAI) and visual anomaly detection in industrial applications.

## Research Interests
My current work involves developing a new approach for learning hard, axis-aligned decision trees using gradient descent. This method employs backpropagation with a straight-through operator on a dense decision tree representation, allowing for the joint optimization of all tree parameters. As a result, we achieve state-of-the-art performance across various domains, including interpretable decision trees and high-performance decision tree ensembles for tabular data, as well as interpretable reinforcement learning without information loss.

My primary research interests include:
* Computer Vision
* Deep Learning for Image Data
* Anomaly Detection
* Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
* Explainable Copmuter Vision (XCV)

### ü§ñ Using Stratified Sampling to Improve LIME Image Explanations @ AAAI-24 
* Our paper was accepted in main technical track and then as a poster presentation, only 100 random papers were selected out of 2200 accepted papers and all the papers also required to be presented as poster presentation as well including those 100 papers.

* We investigate the use of a stratified sampling approach for LIME Image, a popular model-agnostic explainable AI method for computer vision tasks, in order to reduce the artifacts generated by typical Monte Carlo sampling. Such artifacts are due to the undersampling of the dependent variable in the synthetic neighborhood around the image being explained, which may result in inadequate explanations due to the impossibility of fitting a linear regressor on the sampled data. We then highlight a connection with the Shapley theory, where similar arguments about undersampling and sample relevance were suggested in the past. We derive all the formulas and adjustment factors required for an unbiased stratified sampling estimator. Experiments show the efficacy of the proposed approach.. The method is available under: https://github.com/rashidrao-pk/lime_stratified

### üå≥üß† Decision Trees That Remember: Gradient-Based Learning of Recurrent Decision Trees with Memory @ ICLR 25 NFAM Workshop
* Our paper was accepted at the ICLR 25 Workshop on New Frontiers in Associative Memories
* We propose ReMeDe trees, a recurrent decision tree architecture with internal memory, enabling efficient learning for sequential data through hard, axis-aligned decision trees trained via gradient descent.
* üîç Why does this matter?
  * Captures long-term dependencies like RNNs but retains the axis-alignment and transparency of decision trees
  * Handles sequential data without relying on fixed-size memory windows or hand-crafted features
  * Trained efficiently via Backpropagation-Through-Time
